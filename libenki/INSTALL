Source distribution

This section explains how to install libenki from the source distribution.

Prerequisites

To compile libenki and programs who depend on it, you need a working and fairly recent c++ compiler (at least 3.4 when using g++ because gcc 3.3 or lower does not yet understand some of the templates used), a working sh compatible shell and the following libraries:
* liban (http://lis.epfl.ch/resources/download/)
* libboost (http://www.boost.org/)

Compilation

Once you have downloaded and extracted the libenki source distribution, you have to configure it by typing:
./configure
in libenki's directory. Then you can make it by typing:
make
and install it system wide by typing (you need to be root for this step if your install destination folder (default /usr/local) is not writable from your normal user):
make install

SVN

This section explains how to compile libenki from an SVN snapshot. It assumes that libenki is already extracted from SVN and does not explain how to use SVN. For an introduction to SVN, visit: http://subversion.tigris.org

Prerequisites

To bootstrap libenki from SVN, you need the following additional tools:
* automake
* autoconf

Generating configure

You first need to create the configure-file by doing:
./bootstrap
You can then follow the instructions found in the Compilation section above.
